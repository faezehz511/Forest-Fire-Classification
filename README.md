# Forest-Fire-Classification

the question involves performing binary classification for fire and non-fire detection in forest landscapes using logistic regression. The steps include pre-processing the images, splitting the dataset, training the logistic regression model, evaluating its performance, finding the best probability threshold, saving the model, and using it to make predictions on new forest images. The predictions will be displayed with color-coded labels indicating fire or non-fire and their corresponding probabilities.
